# Test webpage for showcasing safebox client & Autonomi extension

This application provides a way to test the functionality of the local safebox client by communicating through the safebox chrome browser extension. It allows you to download and upload files.

Be sure to change the extension ID in the .env file of your project root.

You can find the extension ID to use in your chrome browsers extensions panel once you have installed the extension.

From there find the long code that is underneath your extension name.

To run this application use: 'yarn run dev'
